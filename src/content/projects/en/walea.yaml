  Walea has set itself the goal of creating a platform for offers of help with
  mental illness. The support services were previously maintained and managed
  directly via the website using Wordpress, which was not very user-friendly.

  The development of a new application was intended to simplify maintenance for
  the team and improve access to the support services. The application was built
  using the t3 stack, resulting in a full-stack application with Next.js and a
  direct database connection via Prisma and tRPC.
