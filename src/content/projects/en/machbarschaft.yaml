title: Machbarschaft
description: >-
  Machbarschaft was created as part of the WirVsVirus Hackathon 2020. We got
  together in a team to develop a solution for neighborhood help. The result was
  a telephone bot that records and processes requests for help and makes them
  available to helpers via a platform. The project was recognized as one of the
  best 20 out of 1500 projects.
