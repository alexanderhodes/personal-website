  Legmon aims to support young people and tackle the issues of equal
  opportunities and social mobility. It is an offer consisting of mentoring,
  content area (YouTube and Instagram) and habit tracking through an app. The
  app serves as a combination of content from the different areas.

  Initially, there was a native app for Android and iOS. This led to various
  problems, as user data was stored locally and an app release was required for
  content updates.

  When developing the React Native app, I also developed a backend that stores
  data in a Postgres database. The content from the content area can be
  maintained and edited independently via a CMS. This has made the content in
  the app much more flexible.
