title: Musiccan
description: >-
  Musiccan was the idea of a team that took part in Jugend gr√ºndet in the
  2022/2023 competition year and reached the final. The idea was to develop an
  app that helps music students learn with the help of artificial intelligence.

  For the presentation in the final, I developed a prototype that shows how it
  works with the recording of pieces and visualizes the recording of the piece
  of music.
